# Driver-Monitoring-System
Technologies for Autonomous Vehicles course project @ PoliTO <br><br>
This assignment aims to develop a basic Driver Monitoring System capable of detecting driver drowsiness or distraction by analyzing their head and eye gaze directions using an AI model. Based on this information, the program prints an alarm message when critical thresholds are exceeded, indicating that the driver is drowsy or distracted
